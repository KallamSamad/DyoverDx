## DyoverDx - An interactive maths website for GCSE students

# Description

Contains many useful pages for GCSE students on mathematics. It also has interactive JavaScript quizzes at the end of the topic.

I made this website after my foundation year with minimal knowledge on CSS and JS respectively. I knew Python really well and I designed and implemented the algorithms in Python and used AI to translate the code to JS and design the UI. I learned
a lot from this project as I learned bh "doin" familiarising myself with how things work. For example I now know that to generate a random number I use Math.floor(Math.Random() *x) and you can see me using this 


I used AI to translate the python code 
For example, in <link href="https://github.com/KallamSamad/DyoverDx/blob/main/Assets/js/quiz4.1.js">facorising single brackets</link> I used a recursive function 
called gcd so the expression is fully factorised by and gives the correct answer. This works because it is how the Euclidian Algorithm works which I read up on in <link href="https://mrce.in/ebooks/Maths-Discrete%20Mathematics%20&%20its%20Applications%208th%20Ed.pdf">Discrete mathematics and its applications</link>
I applied my theory into making these algorithms with python and in the early stages of this website I used AI to translate Python code to JS code since my knowledge on JS was minimal. As of 08/08/25 I have a very good grasp on JS and now know

  <h1>Expressions</h1>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <p>Learn these definitions first.</p>
  <p>A <b>term</b> is a part of an expression which can be a variable or a constant.</p>

  <p><i>Constant</i> – A constant is a value in maths that will never change. 
    <span style="color:red;">e.g. 1, 2, 3, π</span>
  </p>

  <p><i>Variable</i> – A variable is a value in maths that can change. Its value <i>varies</i>. 
    <span style="color:red;">x, y, z</span>
  </p>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <p>Think of the number of students in each form group. Will it always be the same? No, some classes will have more people than others. So the number of students in each form group will <i>change</i> – it's not a fixed number. For example, some classes will have 30, some might have 28. So it is a variable number. We can represent it with a letter like <code>x</code>.</p>

  <p>Now think of the number of days in a week. There are 7 days in a week – this will never change. In other words, there is a constant number of days in a week.</p>

  <h2>Like Terms</h2>
  <p>In algebra, when we have two or more <i>like terms</i>, we can add, subtract, multiply or divide them like any other number. Like terms are terms that have the same variables.</p>
  <p>For example, you can add <code>7x</code> and <code>4x</code> to get <code>11x</code>. But <code>7x + 3y</code> cannot be simplified further because the variables are different.</p>

  <p>An expression is a collection of <b>terms</b>.</p>

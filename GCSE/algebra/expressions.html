  <h1>Expressions</h1>
  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <p>Learn these definitions first.</p>
  <p>A term is a part of an expression which can be a variable or a constant.</p>
  <p><i>Constant</i> - A constant is a value in maths that will never change. <style=color:"red;">eg. 1, 2, 3, π </style></p>
  <p><i>Variable</i> - A variable is a value in maths that can change. It's value <i>varies</i>. <style=color:"red;">x,y,z</style></p>

  <h2>Application</h2>
  <p>Think of the number of students in each form group. Will it always be the same? No, some classes will have more people than others. So the number of students in each year group will <i>change</i> - it's not a fixed number. Some classes will have 30,
    some classes will have 28 etc. So it is a variable number. In other words you can say the number of students in a form group is x.</p>
  <p>Now think of the number of days in a week. There a 7 days in a week - this will never change. In other words there is a constant number of days in a week.</p>

  <h2>Like terms</h2>
  <p>In algebra, when we have two <i>like terms</i>, which are terms that have the same variables (7x+2x) or are both constants, we can add, subtract, multiply or divide them like any other number.
      <p>An expression is a collection of <b>terms</b>.</p>

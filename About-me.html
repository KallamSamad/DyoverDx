<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am a computer science student in my first year, and I am building this website as a project to practice my coding skills while helping people with their maths at the same time.</p>
<p>Textbooks are expensive, and I found this the case during my GCSE years. DyoverDx will be an open-source, free-to-use resource for every GCSE student in the country, providing an accessible and affordable way to learn.</p>
<p>I love solving puzzles, playing chess, video games, and, of course, coding.</p>
<h2>Why choose DyOverDx?</h2>
<p>First and foremost, it’s free! The platform will feature end-of-lesson quizzes created with JavaScript so that every time you finish an exercise, it is automatically marked and graded. This will help you track your progress and identify areas where you need to improve.</p>
<p>DyoverDx uses active recall techniques to help you remember content and practice questions. Soon, I will also be offering tutoring services at a low rate of £5/hour, directly linked to this website.</p>
<p>I believe I am qualified to help you achieve the grade you want by offering both self-paced learning and personalized support.</p>

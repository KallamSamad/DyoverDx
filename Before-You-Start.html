  <h1>Before you Begin</h1>
  <p>There are many things that make maths difficult. Lack of practice, unfamiliarity and most importantly the <i>the limits you put on yourself.</i></p>
  <p>So before we begin I would like to convince you to change your own perception on maths. So here are a few things to consider.</p>
  <h2>1) Growth mindset</h2>
  <i> “The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>
  <p>A growth mindset is simply turning your "I can't do this" statements into "I could do this". Giving things a try before giving up. Ultimately being more open minded about things.</p>

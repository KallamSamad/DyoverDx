  <h1>Before you Begin</h1>
  <p>There are many things that make maths difficult. Lack of practice, unfamiliarity and most importantly the <i>the limits you put on yourself.</i></p>
  <p>So before we begin I would like to convince you to change your own perception on maths. So here are a few things to consider.</p>
  <h2>1) Growth mindset</h2>
  <i> “The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>
  <p>A growth mindset is simply turning your "I can't do this" statements into "I could do this". Giving things a try before giving up. Ultimately being more open minded about things.</p>
  <img src="growth.webp" src="Growth mindset vs Fixed mindset" width="40%">
  <p>Part of the reason why you don't seem to good at maths is because you choose to stay bad at maths, which <i>makes</i> you bad at maths.</p>
  <p>So, from now, remove any labels you have on the subject and most importantly, labels you have on capabilities. Only then you will start to improve.</p>
  <h2><i>2) "I don't know how to revise"</i></h2>
  <p>A lot of people don't know <i>how</i> to revise. Well, I'd like to say it's your lucky day, because I'll tell you - you have to figure it out yourselves. Now I say this before giving you some options so you can decide. There are so many methods out there. But the most common one is to learn by <i>rote</i></p>
  <p>This method seems to work for a lot of people. Read your notes, constantly. Then repeat. Do this until you remember. People might think that this is the <i>only</i> method but there are more.</p>
  <p>It depends on what kind of person you are. This is exciting because you're going to learn in your <i>own</i> terms in a creative way.</p>
  <h3>Why the <i>Rote</i> method isn't the best way to learn</h3>
  <p>The rote method is good to many and has been used for many years, and it works, but you have to admit one thing. It's <i>boring.</i> So it isn't necassarily the subject, it is the way you learn and there are many ways to learn.</p>
  <p>They usually have something to do with your senses.</p>
  <p>By the way, not every option here will apply to you.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Visual learning - Watching videos, drawing diagrams and more. This is necassary for some subjects, especially when you are learning about the parts of a system i.e. leanring the diagram of a heart 
    <li>Auditory learning - Listening to a source to help you learn. This can be a recording of your notes or someone else's. There are some good resources out there that have traslated science notes into songs.</li>
    <li>Verbal- A verbal learner prefers using words, both in speech and writing, to understand and communicate ideas.</li>
    <li>Kinasthetic - A kinesthetic learner understands best by doing, touching, and moving—they learn through physical experience. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now, not all of these examples will be approptiate for every subject, but these are different types of ways you can learn with your senses. The trick is to try and use as much as these as you can. For example, watching videos <i>and</i> listening to notes.</p>
  <p>There are more methods but I want to introduce you to two concepts - <i>active recall</i> and <i>spaced repetition</i></p>
  <h2>Active recall</h2>
  <p>Active recall is exactly what it sounds like. You <i>actively</i> try to remember the information by doing the following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reading flashcards and using software such as Anki</li>
    <li>Quizes</li>
    <li>Using the <i>Feynmann technique</i></li>
    <li>Drawing a minmap with all correct notes and constanlty trying to draw another one to look like the original</li>
    <li>Doing practice questions</li>
    <li>Doing practice tests</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The common theme here is repetitiion, but it's different from the <i>rote</i> method because you're allowing yourself <i>forget</i> with...</p>
  <h2>...Spaced repitition</h2>

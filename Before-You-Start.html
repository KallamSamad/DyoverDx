  <h1>Before you Begin</h1>
  <p>There are many things that make maths difficult. Lack of practice, unfamiliarity and most importantly the <i>the limits you put on yourself.</i></p>
  <p>So before we begin I would like to convince you to change your own perception on maths. So here are a few things to consider.</p>
  <h2>1) Growth mindset</h2>
  <i> “The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be.” – Ralph Waldo Emerson</i>
  <p>A growth mindset is simply turning your "I can't do this" statements into "I could do this". Giving things a try before giving up. Ultimately being more open minded about things.</p>
  <img src="growth.webp" src="Growth mindset vs Fixed mindset" width="40%">
  <p>Part of the reason why you don't seem to good at maths is because you choose to stay bad at maths, which <i>makes</i> you bad at maths.</p>
  <p>So, from now, remove any labels you have on the subject and most importantly, labels you have on capabilities. Only then you will start to improve.</p>
  <h2><i>2) "I don't know how to revise"</i></h2>
  <p>A lot of people don't know <i>how</i> to revise. Well, I'd like to say it's your lucky day, because I'll tell you - you have to figure it out yourselves. There are so many methods out there. But the most common one is to learn by <i>rote</i></p>
  <p>This method seems to work for a lot of people. Read your notes, constantly. Then repeat. Do this until you remember.</p>

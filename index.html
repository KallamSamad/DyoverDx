        Mathematics… the very word can be daunting to some and like a chore to many. You do it because you *have* to, but not really because you *want* to. I was in the same boat at one point. Maths seemed boring and repetitive, and I was in the bottom set for during secondary school for the first few years, in maths. I couldn’t understand why we needed to include letters when there are already an infinite number of numbers anyway. A few years later, I ended up with a grade 8 (A*). So, what did I do differently? This website is my way of sharing the methods I used to turn things around. I’ll walk you through what worked for me – and what didn’t – so you can find the strategies that will help you succeed in math too. Are you ready to change your grades forever?

    <p>Mathematics – the very word can be daunting to some, and like a chore to many. You do it because you <i>have</i> to, but not necessarily because you <i>want</i> to. I was in the same boat at one point. Math seemed boring and repetitive, and I was in the bottom set for my GCSEs. I couldn’t understand why we needed to include letters when there are already an infinite number of numbers anyway.A few years later, I ended up with a grade 8 (A*). So, what did I do differently?This website is my way of sharing the methods I used to turn things around. I’ll walk you through what worked for me – and what didn’t – so you can find the strategies that will help you succeed in math too.Are you ready to change your grades forever? </p>
